# Oura-Ring-API
This is a python script to query data from the online Oura database to an external .xlsx document
You will need to create personal access tokens for all persons data you desire to extract. You can do this on the oura ring official website through any member account. 
Format the access tokens in an xlsx where the first two columns are listed "Player Name" and "Tokens" respectively. This script was developed to accommodate a whole team of people with Oura rings. Then populate down the column with as many names and corresponding access tokens you desire to extract data for. Ensure that this xlsx file is in the same folder as the script.
